NHideAndSeek features a powerful particle effects system that allows players to purchase and use cosmetic effects during gameplay. Effects are triggered on specific game events and can be fully customized.


## Effect Events

Effects are triggered on three main game events:

---

## Effect Shop

Players can purchase effects using coins earned from gameplay.

### Opening the Shop

```
/has effects
/has shop
```

### Shop Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Browse Effects" icon="store">
    View all available effects categorized by event type
  </Card>
  <Card title="Preview System" icon="eye">
    See effect descriptions and costs before purchase
  </Card>
  <Card title="Purchase Effects" icon="coins">
    Buy effects using earned coins
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manage Owned" icon="circle-check">
    Select which effects to use for each event
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Cost System

Effect costs are configurable per effect:
- **Free**: Default effects (always available)
- **500-1000**: Basic effects
- **1000-1500**: Premium effects

---

## Creating Custom Effects

### Step 1: Define the Effect

Add your effect to `effects.yml`:

```yaml
available-effects:
  my-custom-effect:
    display-name: "&b&lᴍy ᴄᴜꜱᴛᴏᴍ ᴇꜰꜰᴇᴄᴛ"
    display-item: "DIAMOND"
    lore:
      - "&7An amazing custom effect"
      - "&7that does something cool"
      - ""
      - "&e&lCost: &f%cost% coins"
    event: "WIN"
    cost: 2000
    permission: "has.effect.custom"

    type: "helix"
    particle: "DUST"
    radius: 1.5
    height: 3.0
    rotations: 3
    points: 60
    duration: 50
    color:
      r: 0
      g: 200
      b: 255
```

### Step 2: Reload the Plugin

```
/has reload
```

Your custom effect will now appear in the shop!

---

## Permission System

Effects can be restricted with permissions:

```yaml
effect-name:
  permission: "has.effect.effectname"
```

### Permission Behavior

- **No Permission Set**: Available to all players (must purchase)
- **With Permission**: Only players with permission can see and purchase
- **VIP Effects**: Grant permissions to VIP ranks for exclusive effects

### Example Permissions

```yaml
# Server permissions config
groups:
  vip:
    permissions:
      - has.effect.rainbow
      - has.effect.lightning
  admin:
    permissions:
      - has.effect.*
```

---

## Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Performance**: Avoid using too many particles or high density values, as this can cause client lag.
</Warning>

### Recommended Values

- **Duration**: 20-60 ticks (1-3 seconds)
- **Points**: 20-60 particles
- **Radius**: 0.5-2.5 blocks
- **Density**: 15-30 particles per tick

### Tips

<Tip>
  **Testing**: Use `/has reload` to test effect changes without restarting the server.
</Tip>

- Test effects in-game before releasing to players
- Use appropriate particles for effect themes (fire for kills, hearts for wins)
- Balance effect costs with gameplay coin earnings
- Consider color schemes that match your server theme

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Effect not showing in shop">
    - Check YAML syntax in `effects.yml`
    - Ensure the effect has `display-name` and `display-item`
    - Verify the player has required permissions (if set)
    - Run `/has reload` after making changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Particles not appearing">
    - Verify particle name is correct (see Available Particles)
    - Check if `REDSTONE` should be `DUST`
    - Ensure duration > 0
    - Check player render distance settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Colors not working">
    - RGB colors only work with `DUST` particle
    - Color values must be between 0-255
    - Check YAML indentation for `color:` section
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Effect too laggy">
    - Reduce `points` or `density` values
    - Lower `duration` for shorter effects
    - Avoid multiple effects triggering simultaneously
    - Test on lower-end clients
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
