---

Setting up arenas is a fundamental part of NHideAndSeek. This guide covers arena creation, configuration, and spawn point management.

---

## Creating an Arena

### Basic Creation

To create a new arena, use the following command:

```bash
/has create <arenaName>
```

<Warning>
Arena names should be unique and consist of alphanumeric characters. Spaces and special characters are not recommended.
</Warning>

**Example:**
```bash
/has create parkour
/has create skyblock_hide
/has create forest_escape
```

After creating an arena, the plugin will initialize it with default settings. You'll need to configure spawn points next.

---

## Arena Editor Mode

### Entering Editor Mode

To set spawn points and define the arena boundaries, enter editor mode:

```bash
/has editor <arenaName>
```

**Example:**
```bash
/has editor parkour
```

### Editor Controls

Once in editor mode, you can set spawn locations:

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Left Click** | Set Position 1 (with item in hand) |
| **Right Click** | Set Position 2 (with item in hand) |
| **Drop Item** | Clear current selection |

### Exiting Editor Mode

To exit editor mode, use the same command again:

```bash
/has editor <arenaName>
```

---

## Spawn Point Management

### Setting Spawn Points

After defining the arena area in editor mode, you need to set specific spawn points for different player roles also in editor mode.

```bash
/has setspawn <type>
```

#### Spawn Point Types

| Type | Purpose | Who Spawns Here |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **lobby** | Main lobby spawn | All players initially |
| **hider** | Hider starting location | Players assigned as Hiders |
| **seeker** | Seeker starting location | Players assigned as Seekers |
| **spectator** | Spectator area | Players watching the game |

### Setting Each Spawn Type

Stand at the desired location and execute the command:

```bash
# Set lobby spawn (where players join)
/has setspawn lobby

# Set hider spawn (where hiders start hiding)
/has setspawn hider

# Set seeker spawn (where seekers begin searching)
/has setspawn seeker

# Set spectator spawn (where spectators watch)
/has setspawn spectator
```

<Tip>
Set the lobby spawn first, then hider, seeker, and spectator spawns. Test each spawn location in-game to ensure they're correct.
</Tip>

## Arena Configuration

### Opening Settings Menu

To configure arena settings, use:

```bash
/has settings <arenaName>
```

This opens an inventory-based GUI where you can adjust various settings.

### Configurable Settings

| Setting | Range | Default | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Min Players** | 1-100 | 2 | Minimum players to start game |
| **Max Players** | 2-100 | 20 | Maximum player capacity |
| **Game Duration** | 30-3600s | 300s | Total game length (5 minutes) |
| **Seeker Ratio** | 2-10 | 4 | 1 seeker per X players |
| **Hiding Time** | 5-300s | 20s | Grace period before seekers release |
| **Hider Scale** | 0.1-1.0 | 0.4 | Hider size multiplier (40% of normal) |
| **Speed Amplifier** | 0-5 | 2 | Hider speed boost level |
| **Fireball Cooldown** | 0.5-10s | 2s | Seconds between fireball shots |
| **Fireball Damage** | 0.5-20 | 5 | Damage per fireball hit |
| **Unlimited Fireballs** | true/false | false | Unlimited fireball mode |

### Understanding Game Settings

#### Player Limits

```
Min Players: 2  →  Game won't start with less than 2 players
Max Players: 20 →  Arena capacity is 20 players maximum
```

#### Seeker Ratio

```
Seeker Ratio: 4
├─ 4-7 players   → 1 seeker
├─ 8-11 players  → 2 seekers
├─ 12-15 players → 3 seekers
└─ 16+ players   → 4+ seekers (continues pattern)
```

#### Hider Settings

- **Hider Scale**: At 0.4, hiders are 40% of normal size, making them harder to see
- **Speed Amplifier**: Level 2 means hiders move 20% faster
- **Hiding Time**: 20 seconds before seekers are released - gives hiders time to hide

#### Fireball Settings

- **Cooldown**: 2 seconds between shots means seekers can shoot every 2 seconds
- **Damage**: 5 damage means 4 fireballs = 1 hider eliminated (assuming hiders have 20 health)
- **Unlimited**: When enabled, seekers don't need items to shoot fireballs

## Arena Management

### Listing Arenas

To see all created arenas:

```bash
/has list
```

This displays all arenas with their current status and player count.

### Deleting an Arena

To remove an arena completely:

```bash
/has delete <arenaName>
```

<Danger>
Deleting an arena is permanent. All arena data will be lost. Players currently in that arena will be kicked to the main lobby.
</Danger>


## Game Control

### Starting a Game

Once players have joined an arena, start the game:

```bash
/has start
```

This initiates a countdown (default: 10 seconds) before the game begins.

<Info>
You must have the minimum number of players for the game to start. Use `/has forcestart` to bypass this check.
</Info>

### Force Starting

To start a game regardless of player count:

```bash
/has forcestart <arenaName>
```

### Stopping a Game

To end an active game prematurely:

```bash
/has stop
```

The arena will reset to the waiting state, and all players will be moved to the spectator area.

### Force Stopping

To forcefully stop any game:

```bash
/has forcestop <arenaName>
```

## Best Practices

### Arena Design Tips

1. **Lobby Area**: Make it spacious and easy to navigate
   - Use clear walkways
   - Separate from gameplay area
   - Add signs for directions

2. **Hider Spawn**: Place away from seeker spawn
   - Give hiders a running start
   - Avoid cramped spaces
   - Ensure multiple escape routes

3. **Seeker Spawn**: Central location
   - Allows coverage of entire map
   - Balanced distance to hider spawns
   - Elevated position for visibility (optional)

4. **Spectator Area**: Elevated or isolated
   - Won't interfere with gameplay
   - Good visibility of action
   - Protected from fireballs

### Configuration Recommendations

**For Casual Play:**
```
Min Players: 3
Max Players: 20
Game Duration: 5 minutes (300s)
Seeker Ratio: 4
Hiding Time: 20s
Hider Scale: 0.4
Speed Amplifier: 2
Fireball Damage: 5
```

**For Competitive/Tournament:**
```
Min Players: 6
Max Players: 16
Game Duration: 8 minutes (480s)
Seeker Ratio: 3
Hiding Time: 30s
Hider Scale: 0.5
Speed Amplifier: 1
Fireball Damage: 3
```

**For Streamer Events:**
```
Min Players: 4
Max Players: 12
Game Duration: 10 minutes (600s)
Seeker Ratio: 5
Hiding Time: 45s
Hider Scale: 0.3
Speed Amplifier: 3
Fireball Damage: 4
Unlimited Fireballs: true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Arena Won't Start

**Problem**: Clicking start but nothing happens

**Solutions**:
1. Check player count meets minimum requirement: `/has list`
2. Ensure all spawn points are set: `/has editor <arena>` then `/has settings <arena>`
3. Check console for error messages
4. Use `/has forcestart` if minimum players requirement is the issue

### Players Spawning in Wrong Location

**Problem**: Players spawning outside arena or in water

**Solutions**:
1. Re-set spawn points: `/has setspawn <type>`
2. Ensure spawn location is solid ground
3. Check Y-coordinate is not too high or low
4. Test spawn by joining arena

### Game Ending Too Quickly

**Problem**: Games end before expected time

**Solutions**:
1. Check game duration setting: `/has settings <arena>`
2. Verify hiders have adequate hiding spots
3. Ensure hider speed and size are balanced
4. Check seeker ratio isn't too high

### Fireballs Not Working

**Problem**: Seekers can't shoot fireballs

**Solutions**:
1. Check fireball damage isn't set to 0
2. Verify cooldown isn't too long
3. Ensure seekers are in SEEKER role
4. Check if "Unlimited Fireballs" is disabled - if so, seekers need fireball items

## Advanced Configuration

### Database Integration

Arenas are automatically saved to the configured database (SQLite by default). No additional setup needed.

### Custom World Support

Arenas can span multiple worlds. When setting spawns, the current world is automatically recorded.

### Performance Optimization

For large arenas or servers with many arenas:
1. Keep arena sizes reasonable (under 10,000 blocks)
2. Avoid overly complex terrain
3. Limit active games with max player count
4. Monitor server TPS
