## Core Gameplay

### Pre-Assigned Role System

Admins can assign specific players to roles (Seeker/Hider) before the game starts directly in the lobby. This feature enables content creators and event organizers to control team composition precisely.

```bash
/has setrole <player> <role>
# Example: /has setrole Youtuber seeker
```

### Automatic Role Assignment

Remaining players are automatically distributed among roles based on the configurable seeker ratio. This ensures balanced teams throughout the game.

- **Default Ratio**: 1 seeker per 4 players
- **Example**: 10 players = 2-3 seekers automatically assigned

### Fireball Mechanics

Seekers can shoot fireballs to eliminate hiders. All mechanics are fully customizable:

- Adjustable damage (0.5-20 per hit)
- Cooldown between shots (0.5-10 seconds)
- Optional unlimited fireball mode
- Explosion radius customization

### Hider Enhancement Effects

Hiders receive special effects to balance gameplay and enhance the hiding experience:

- **Size Reduction**: Scale from 0.1x to 1.0x
- **Speed Boost**: Up to 5 levels of speed amplification
- **Optional Invisibility**: Temporary invisibility cloak ability
